# TRONOMEGA

## About:

TRONOMEGA transforms a high-speed RC racing car into an autonomous robot capable of real-time image processing and path detection. Utilizing a robust hardware setup including a modified chassis, high-performance motors, and an Intel NUC Mini PC, alongside a sophisticated software architecture built on Python and OpenCV, this robot demonstrates advanced capabilities in autonomous navigation and control.

## Hardware

- **Chassis**: Customized from a 2.4 GHz RC Racing Car, equipped with adjustable rods for camera mounting.
- **Motors**: Includes a 1000 rpm brushed motor for wheel control and a servo motor for steering.
- **Motor Driver**: RKI Motor Driver, supporting 6V-24V motors, with a peak current capacity of 20A.
- **Computing**: Intel NUC Mini PC, facilitating onboard processing with comprehensive connectivity options.
- **Power**: Dual power systems featuring a 50000 mAh power bank for the Mini PC and additional batteries for motor and peripheral components.
- **Communication**: HC-05 Bluetooth Module for wireless control and data transmission.

## Software

- **Main Programming**: Developed in Python, leveraging the OpenCV library for image processing and path detection.
- **Image Processing**: Utilizes dual webcams for real-time image acquisition, employing techniques such as greyscale conversion, blurring, edge detection (Canny), and color thresholding for navigation and control.
- **Control Algorithm**: Incorporates PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) control for precise steering and speed regulation, enabling the robot to navigate complex courses with high accuracy.

## Research and Development

The project involved extensive R&D, particularly in optimizing the Python-based control algorithm. The implementation of PID control significantly enhanced the robot's steering capabilities, allowing for sharp turns and optimal speed control.
